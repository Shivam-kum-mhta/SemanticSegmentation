# SemanticSegmentation

## This project introduces a U-Net-based algorithm for efficient semantic segmentation of aerial imagery to accurately classify each pixel with its corresponding object class. <br> 
 The model exploits the encoder-decoder structure of the U-Net architecture, providing effective feature extraction and spatial localization. It is suitable for the segmentation of high-resolution aerial imagery.

 ### A side project for the course IT204 [ Signals and Systems ].
